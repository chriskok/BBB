## Question 9 
- many question were quite similar with one or two keywords that differ 
    - wasn't too sure what made a good/bad answer personally having little familiarity with the subject matter 
    - a few clusters I have were a little close with an added point (potentially) for their keywords (e.g. registered click event vs registered click event with renderer OR display michigan data vs renderer displays selected data)
    - I have a cluster for too little info as well (i.e. update page, or callback) and some because they mention the DOM specifically (i.e. change DOM)

## Question 24
- felt like this question was better for clustering (many kinds of more secure clusters because of the question itself)
- I should write a description index for all the different cluster (what I meant and what points I'd give) -> maybe this could be a separate page
