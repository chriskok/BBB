AUTO SCENARIO 2

- Design Consistency: Emphasizes the benefit of maintaining uniformity in the design through reusable components.
- Time Efficiency: Highlights the time-saving aspect of reusing instead of recreating elements.
- Easy Update and Modification: Explains the convenience of making alterations in one place that reflect in all instances.
- Interactivity facilitation: Expounds on how components can simplify adding interactive features. 
- Reduction in Repetitive Effort: Points out reducing duplication of tasks by reusing similar parts or templates across projects.

Positive Rubric Items:

- Design Consistency Understanding: Demonstrates the concept of maintaining uniform design. (Example: "We would want to use components to make it re-usable.")
- Time Efficiency Cognizance: Clearly expresses the time-saving benefits of using components. (Example: "So we can easily reuse instances instead of making new elements from scratch.")
- Proper Grasp on Updatability: Explains the easy update and modification convenience rightly. (Example: "They can be easily copied and reused throughout the project, and if a change needs to be made...")
- Interactivity Handling Comprehension: Understands using components can aid in adding interactive features. (Example: "So we can easily interact with the item and change the state of it.")
- Reduction in Repetitive Effort Appreciation: Identifies how reusing components reduces duplication of effort. (Example: "Using components in Figma allows designers to create instances that can be easily reused...")

Negative Rubric Items:

- Poor Design Consistency Explanation: Fails to properly indicate how components aid in upholding design uniformity. 
- Misunderstanding Time Efficiency Aspect: Doesn't relate the efficient use of time to using components. 
- Confusing Updatability of Components: Provides incorrect or unclear explanation regarding updating components. 
- Misconception in Interactivity Element: Misrepresents or fails to mention how components facilitate adding interactive aspects. 
- Overlooking Redundancy Reduction: Omits or misunderstands how components help in curbing repetitive tasks.

AUTO NO THEME SCENARIO

Positive Rubric Items:

- Understanding of Reusability: Student correctly identifies that components can be reused multiple times.
- Proper Application Context: Student accurately describes a practical usage for components in Figma, e.g., creating buttons.
- Understanding of Consistency: Student appreciates the role of components in maintaining design consistency.
- Knowledge of Efficiency: Student recognizes that components can reduce the need to recreate the same design elements.
- Recognizing Flexibility: Student understands the use of components in making changes quickly to all instances.

Negative Rubric Items:

- Lack of Practical Understanding: Student fails to provide examples of using components in Figma.
- Misunderstanding Reusability: Student doesn't acknowledge that components can be reused across multiple designs.
- Ignoring Consistency: Student overlooks the important role of components in maintaining design consistency.
- Not Acknowledging Efficiency: Student doesn't recognize the time-saving aspect of using components.
- Ignoring Propagation: Student doesn't mention that changes will affect all instances of a component.
