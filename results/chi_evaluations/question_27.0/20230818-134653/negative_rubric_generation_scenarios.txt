AUTO SCENARIO 2

- Efficiency in design: Various references to components improving design efficiency.
- Element reusability: Recurring theme of the ability to reuse components multiple times.
- Consistency across design: Accentuation on coherence and uniformity due to components.
- Time saving: Multiple mentions of time conservation achieved with component use.
- Interactive components: Frequent emphasis on interactivity within components.

Positive Rubric Items:
- Understanding reusability: Demonstrates understanding of component reusability for efficiency (example: "We can group together multiple elements, and we can reuse components across our design.")
- Time-saving applications: Recognizes the convenience and time-saving potential of components (example: "It allows us to build a smaller part of a greater system and enables us to reuse existing parts saving us time on otherwise repetitive and tedious work.")
- Comprehension of interactive components: Shows insights into the interactive potentials of components (example: "Components in Figma are interactive allowing the user to navigate to other pages or update the information on the page through different variants.")
- Maintaining design consistency: Displays awareness of the role of components in maintaining design consistency (example: "Components allow designers to reuse elements in design such as buttons and this ensures it is consistent across the design which will follow the Consistency and standards heuristic.")
- Component link feature: Demonstrates understanding of the feature that links original components with its instances (example: "Using components in Figma allows designers to create instances of an object that are linked together.")

Negative Rubric Items:
- Lack of specific examples: Fails to provide specific examples of where components can be used (example: "They can be reused across designs. This makes designs much more efficient.")
- Vague about reusability: Doesn't explain how components can be reused in designs (example: "This is because with components allow us to reuse certain elements throughout our prototype.")
- Misses interactive features: Overlooks the interactive features of components (example: "Components make it easier to create the element repeatedly from a single source of truth.")
- Neglects design consistency: Does not indicate knowledge about components' role in design consistency (example: "Components allow us to make reusable design elements which can save a lot of time and effort.")
- Ignoring propagation feature: Neglects to discuss the propagation feature of components (example: "We use Components to create instances in Figma so that way we are able to reuse certain things over and over again, whether it be a checkbox or a other things similar to it.")

AUTO SCENARIO 3

- Efficiency and Reusability: Components avoid creating the same element repeatedly, increasing work efficiency.
- Design Consistency: Components help maintain a consistent design style across platforms.
- Team Coordination: Facilitates better teamwork by establishing a standard for design elements.
- Convenience and Speed: Components enable designers to reuse parts quickly.
- Universal Components and Variants: Components maintain consistent designs and handle design variations simultaneously.
- Error Management: A few responses discussed how use of components allows for easy corrections.
- Component Customizability: Some students discussed the customizable aspect of components to simplify designs.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Components allow easy changes without manually adjusting each item.
- Centralized Changes: Changes made to a component are automatically applied to all its instances.
- Design Organization: Students discuss the role of components in creating more organized designs.

Positive:
- Efficient Design Creation: Efficient component use reduces repetitious work. (example: "It allows us to build a smaller part of a greater system and enables us to reuse existing parts saving us time on otherwise repetitive and tedious work.")
- Design Consistency Maintenance: Regular component use improves overall design uniformity. (example: "Also, it can help to keep the same design style across the same platform.")
- Mistake Management: Component use simplifies the process of fixing errors swiftly. (example: "By making them into components, we can also change the component to change all the instances, in case we made a mistake or something.")
- Grouped and Reusable Elements: Demonstrates understanding of grouping and reusing design elements. (example: "We can group together multiple elements, and we can reuse components across our design.")
- Standardization and Efficiency: Indicates understanding of component reusability and automatic instance updating for efficient design. (example: "When a change is made to the original component, all of the instances of that component will be updated automatically.")

Negative:
- Misunderstanding Components Purpose: Fails to elaborate on the fundamental purpose and function of components. (example: "We want to use components.")
- Mismatch Of Component Role: Incorrectly attributes roles and functionalities to components. (example: "They add a level of user interactivity to our prototype")
- Incoherent Component Reasoning: The reasoning behind using components is unclear or poorly articulated. (example: "Components make it easier to create the element repeatedly from a single source of truth.")
- Limited Understanding of Components: Only a partial understanding of the potential benefits of components is demonstrated. (example: "This makes designs much more efficient.")
- Superficial Component Importance: Provides oversimplified explanation of the importance of using components in Figma. (example: "So that when we want to change an aspect of the design, we can just change the component.")

AUTO NO THEME SCENARIO

Positive Rubric Items:

- Reusability Understanding: Recognizes components can be reused to save time (example: "It allows us to build a smaller part of a greater system and enables us to reuse existing parts saving us time on otherwise repetitive and tedious work.")
- Efficiency Concept: Explains how components contribute to efficient design work (example: "Using components in Figma allows designers to create instances of an object that are linked together. This means that when a change is made to the original component, all of the instances of that component will be updated automatically to reflect the change.")
- Consistency Knowledge: Understands that components help maintain design consistency (example: "This is so that our instances are consistent throughout our program and we would not have to recreate each instance (e.g. button) every time we would want to use it.")
- UI Understanding: Realizes that components can be useful in creating UI elements (example: "UI components can be reused across multiple screen. We make our design consistent. It also reduces workload.")
- Interaction Awareness: Identifies that components allow for easier interactive elements in a prototype (example: "In prototypes, there are often many reused or very similar parts. Components make it easier to have uniform parts that are copied across the prototype. Additionally, you can add interactivity more easily.")

Negative Rubric Items:

- Misunderstanding Interactivity: Believes that components mainly provide user interactivity (example: "They add a level of user interactivity to our prototype")
- Misinterpretation of Design Elements: Thinks that components are abstract representations of physical elements (example: "Components allow us to create abstract representations of certain physical elements we want to see in our prototype.")
- Missing Efficiency Element: Fails to mention the efficiency of using components (example: "They can be reused across designs. This makes designs much more efficient.")
- Overlooking Updates: Doesn't understand that updating a component updates all instances (example: "We can group together multiple elements, and we can reuse components across our design. This helps with consistent designs.")
- Lack of Understanding on Reusability: Doesn't mention that components lead to design reusability (example: "We use Components to create instances in Figma so that way we are able to reuse certain things over and over again, whether it be a checkbox or other things similar to it.")
