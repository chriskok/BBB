THEMES - 20 ANSWERS

The students' provided answers do not directly address the question of asynchronous programming in Javascript. Instead, they center around the concept of reusable components in the context of design, particularly regarding user interface (UI) design and the tool known as Figma. The main themes include:

1. Reusability and Consistency: Students emphasize the ability to reuse UI components across different frames or pages, leading to consistent designs.

2. Efficiency: The use of components prevents repetitive work and creates a more efficient design process.

3. Manageability: Changes made to a parent, or main, component are reflected in all its instances, keeping designs uniformly updated.

4. Interactivity: Some students mention the interactive possibilities offered by components, including changing states.

5. Minimalistic approach: Components help to keep the design cleaner and more minimalistic, avoiding excessive elements.

6. Time-saving: A component edit propagates to all instances, saving time on implementing changes.

THEMES - 40 ANSWERS

The recurrent themes in the students' responses include:

1. Reusability of components: Components can be defined once and used across multiple areas of an application or design, reducing repetition and promoting efficient use of resources.

2. Consistency of design: Components ensure uniformity across different parts of a project or application, enhancing user experience. Any change made to a component gets reflected everywhere that component is used, ensuring a consistent appearance and behavior.

3. Efficiency and time-saving: Using components saves time and effort by eliminating the need to repeatedly create similar elements or features.

4. Easy maintenance and updates: Components allow for simple updates and modifications. Changes made to a single component automatically apply to all instances of that component, facilitating easy maintenance and updates. 

5. Component instances: Students highlighted the utility of making multiple instances of a component, which share the same properties and behavior. Changes to a component are reflected in all its instances, making it efficient to manage large designs or applications.

6. Streamlined design processes: Components help streamline design processes by reducing workload, enhancing design consistency, and making it easy to implement and manage changes. 

7. Interaction and Interactivity: Components can be used to add interactivity to designs in an efficient way, using instances of a component to create interactive experiences.

8. Grouping of elements: Components allow for easier copying/pasting by grouping multiple elements, allowing for efficient changes to the specifications of all elements at once. 

9. Enhancing User Interface (UI) design: Using components supports the design of UI elements that can be re-used across different screens within a design or application. 

Overall, students emphasized the benefits of using components in their design work, particularly in terms of re-use, efficiency, consistency, and ease of maintenance.
