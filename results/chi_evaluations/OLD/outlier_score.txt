Asynchronous programming allows us to change a page without needed to reload the entire page.	0.6744955778121948	
When writing web apps, we often read and write to a server which takes time. To make sure each function has completely finished running, we need to wait for each function. Otherwise, if we execute in real time (synchronous) we may not get desired output.  As an example, consider an app that writes a to-do list to a server. We want to add an item to the list and then print the list. Adding an item may take more time than printing. So, if asynchronous programming is not used the list that is printed will be the list before the new item was added which is not the desired output.	0.6740943193435669	
A technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that tasks runs, rather than having to wait until that tasks has finished It makes the website faster and provides a user with a better experience because they don't have to wait until one task to run for another one to show up 	0.6736176013946533

It allows us to perform actions that may take some time while still loading the rest of the UI and letting users interact with it.	0.5539259612560272	
If you have several tasks that you want the application to operate. This allows you to complete multiple tasks at once since it isn't necessary for the application to wait to complete them individually. This can be very beneficial in web dev/user experience when delays can occur.	0.5537997484207153	
So that we can change a page without reloading and send, request and receive data from a server while other parts of the interface function well.	0.5537091791629791	
Because sometimes we are in a situation where a line of code may take an indefinite amount of time (like an API fetch), and we don't want to block the whole program while running it, so we run it asynchronously. And if we want to wait for it to complete before running certain other lines, we can use mechanisms like .then()	0.5498426556587219	
This allows us to not interrupt the entire interface when the user prompts the website to make calls to a server. It can run in the background while the user can still interact with the interface.	0.5495370924472809	
 It allows us execute instructions that may take a really long time without blocking the rest of the code so users can still interact with the UI 	0.5472955107688904	
You can be respond to other tasks while you're waiting on a big task to run, which allows for more efficient programming to execute. 	0.5465580224990845	
We are able to take advantage of the functionality as it allows us to express waiting for certain actions without stalling the program. As many programs interact with users, this becomes essential. It allows the parts of the program that don't require input to continue and improves efficiency. 	0.5459156334400177	
We want to use asynchronous programming in Javascript so lines of code execute in a specific order and ensure it is executed based on previous results. For example, when calling an API, we want to use asynchronous programming for the code to wait for the data to be returned before working with the data.	0.5457867980003357	
Tasks over the network always have delays. We want the UI to remain responsive when it is completing a network request, which requires asynchronously fetching data so that it doesn't block the execution of the main thread.	0.5447980165481567	
Its useful as multiple parts of the application can be executed without having to wait for one another, which is especially important in making requests for servers or waiting for complex tasks to load. It also allows you to change a page without reloading it.	0.5442482829093933	
It helps change a page without having to reload it and you can send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface.	0.5434545278549194	
This can allow us to continue to provide function to the user while we wait for a data source to come in. Also, it can help with not refreshing the page.	0.5415445566177368	
Allows the program to start long/expensive running function while still being responsive to other tasks (i.e handle clicks) without blocking and having to wait. Leads to a better user experience	0.5383050441741943	
You want to use asynchronous programming in Javascript to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface. You will be able to change a page without reloading it.	0.5378755331039429	
It allows us to partially update a page instead of needing to reload the page every time an action is done. It also allows users to continue to use the page while a long action is being done asynchronously.	0.5376946330070496	
It allows us to make changes to pages without reloading. Additionally, we can send, request, and receive data from our server without interrupting or blocking the rest of our interface. 	0.5373115837574005	
It enables a program to execute potentially long-running tasks and be responsive to other tasks while it is running. 	0.5367818474769592	
When we are doing I/O functions, we don't want to block the rest of the UI by waiting on that I/O. With async we can do work in the background and still have the UI be functioning while waiting for the I/O to finish.	0.5366672873497009	
We don't want to shoehorn the users into a specific route on the application, we want them to be able to click any button at any time, and this can only be achieved through event listeners and the like which are examples of asynchronous programming.	0.536557525396347	
It enables more dynamic change for users without reloading using webpages. For example, AJAX is used to enable Asynchronous Javascript and XML and it enables you to change a page without reloading as it can send, request, and receive data without immediately reloading the page. This way the user can have a quicker and more streamlined experience on a webpage.	0.5365519523620605	
Because it allows executing time-consuming instructions such as waiting for HTTP responses without blocking the rest of the code so that users can still interact with the UI.	0.5363964438438416	
Async programming allows long running operations to happen while allowing the rest of the app to remain unblocked	0.5346074402332306	
It allows us to update parts of a webpage at a time in order to handle requests to/from servers and avoid having to re-render the entire page.	0.5344288945198059	
We don't have to wait a task to complete. Instead, it allows us to perform other tasks while waiting, which improves efficiency.	0.5327790975570679	
It allows your script to call an action that may take a long time to run without having to pause the entire program to wait for it to finish running	0.5308376550674438	
Because with the amount of stuff we are calling from the server, it might slow down our interface if we try to use synchronous programming	0.5290277600288391	
It allows us to update only part of the webpage instead of reloading the entire page. It also prevents the execution of the programming from blocking if certain processes are taking too long to execute.	0.5276100039482117	
It allows the executing of instructions that take a really long time (HTTP requests), without stopping the rest of the code from running.	0.5273993015289307	
It will help the users making it possible to express waiting for long running actions without freezing the program during these actions. They mainly do this using callbacks, functions which are called when the actions complete. It helps when there are large iterations involved or when operations inside these loops are very complex to handle.	0.5263945758342743	
We can partially update pages without refreshing it, and we can execute instructions without blocking user input, even if they take a long time to execute. 	0.5247820019721985	
Allows you to start a task that might take a long time and in the meantime still be responsive to other tasks while that first task is still running. So basically, you don't need to wait for the first function to finish before doing something else.	0.5238099098205566	
We want to use it because we dont want the website to stall and block execution of other tasks when trying to do a task that might take a lot of time. We want the user to still be able to interact with the website while other parts of the webpage loads.	0.5167383551597595	
We want to use asynchronous programming so we don't need to run one process after another process and can run them simultaneously	0.5141586065292358	
Since it enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished	0.5140413045883179	
It allows partial updates of a page. It also allows users to continue to use the UI without having slow functions block the entire UI.	0.5132555663585663	
We can still use other features when running long-running task. We do not need to wait until the task finished. We can also partially update the page without refreshing the page. 	0.5121727585792542	
It allows multiple tasks to be completed without having to wait on a task that might take longer than the others.	0.5118402540683746	
For updating the web page partially, based on an asynchronous process like a web server api call, without reloading the whole page. It makes the user experience faster because it's only changing the visual elements that need to be changed. Reloading fully will use more resources and time. 	0.5114553570747375	
So we can run multiple tasks on a website instead of having to wait for one task to finish before we start another	0.5109163522720337	
It allows the program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished so essentially it's more time-efficient.	0.5094458758831024	
In javascript, several things may be happening at once. With asynchronous programming, we can update and use different features while others may still be loading, this way the page doesn't have to wait for large elements to load to begin displaying.	0.5091357231140137	
It allows our program to start a long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, as opposed to waiting until  that task finishes.	0.5064082741737366	
It helps us when we are making calls to API's or waiting for things to load on, so that certain parts of the page can be updated when we get the new info that we need and do not need to refresh the whole page. 	0.5043007135391235	
Some resources can take some time to load, but we might not need them to be loaded in order to perform some other bits of code. Instead, we can use asynchronous Javascript to execute unrelated code while resources continue to load in the background. Asynchronous programming is especially important when it comes to loading pages on the internet, since fetching resources from other servers/URLs can take time.	0.5041131377220154	
It allows users to interact with the UI while large instructions get executed. It also allows pages to be partially updated without getting refreshed entirely.	0.5039885938167572
