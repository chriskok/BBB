3. Theme: Asynchronous programming allows for the execution of long-running tasks without pausing the entire program - Common Good Answer
4. Theme: AJAX enabling asynchronous programming to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface - Common Good Answer
5. Theme: Asynchronous programming allows applications to be more responsive and efficient- Common Good Answer

9. Theme: Asynchronous programming allows for unblocking the rest of the app during long operations- Common Misunderstanding

Positive:
- Understanding Non-blocking UI: Demonstrates understanding of non-blocking interfaces. (example: "Asynchronous programming allows us to perform activities that might take some time... without blocking everything else in the user interface.")
- Explaining Page Part Updates: Clearly explains the concept of updating only parts of a page. (example: "We can change a page without reloading it...")
- Identifying Concurrent Execution: Identify the role of async in facilitating the concurrent execution of tasks. (example: "It allows your script to call an action without pausing the entire program.")
- Server Interaction Knowledge: Shows understanding of asynchronous server interactions.  (example: "It allows us to execute instructions from a server without blocking the rest of the interface.")
- User Friendly Highlight: Highlights asynchronous programming's contribution to user experience. (example: "We use async programming in JS because... This would not be very user friendly.")

Negative:
- Misunderstanding Non-blocking UI: Misunderstands the non-blocking nature of asynchronous programming. (example: N/A - No fitting example in the dataset provided)
- Confusing Page Part Updates: Confuses the process of updating parts of a page asynchronously. (example: N/A - No fitting example in the dataset provided)
- Confusion over Concurrent Execution: Misconstrues the role of async in concurrent task execution. (example: N/A - No fitting example in the dataset provided)
- Server Interaction Misconception: Shows a lack of understanding about asynchronous server interaction. (example: N/A - No fitting example in the dataset provided)
- Neglecting User Experience: Fails to mention the benefits of asynchronous programming for user experience. (example: "We want to use asynchronous programming so we don't need to run one process after another process.")

- Understands Non-blocking Concept: Recognizes asynchronous programming prevents UI 'freezing' during time-consuming tasks.
- Knowledge of Page Updates: Realizes asynchronous programming allows partial page updates without reloading.
- Identifies Long-task Handling: Understands asynchronous code doesn't have to wait for long tasks to finish before proceeding.
- AJAX Connection: Understands AJAX is a method for asynchronous communication with a server.
- Grasps Responsiveness Principle: Explains asynchronous programming improves responsiveness and user experience.

Negative Rubric Items: 

- Misunderstands Concurrency: Incorrectly suggests that asynchronous programming in Javascript allows multiple simultaneous tasks.
- Fails to Explain Non-blocking: Doesn't acknowledge asynchronous programming's role in non-blocking user interface interactions.
- Misses AJAX Interaction: Doesn't mention AJAX when discussing asynchronous server communication.
- Overlooks Partial Updates: Misses that asynchronous programming allows for partial, not just full page, updates.
- Inadequate Response: Provides an unclear or too short explanation of asynchronous programming's purpose or function.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTO SCENARIO 2

- Partial page updating: Refreshing specific components rather than reloading whole page.
- Non-blocking interface: Ensuring user interface remains interactive during long running tasks.
- Simultaneous processing: Executing multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for others.
- AJAX utilization: Using AJAX for improving webpage efficiency and user experience.
- Large request handling: Managing extensive operations or iterations without freezing the program. 
- Responsiveness: Keeping the application responsive to other events while a task is resolving.

Positive Rubric Items:
1. Partial Page Updating Understanding: Demonstrates grasp of component-specific refreshing (example: "We use asynchronous programming sowe don't need to refresh the page everytime the user makes a request.")
2. Non-Blocking Interface Concepts: Explains how UI remains interactable during lengthy tasks (example: "we are able to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface.")
3. Simultaneous Execution: Describes concurrent task processing (example: "This allows us to perform multiple tasks at once without blocking the execution from a different task.")
4. AJAX Knowledge: Illustrates AJAX's role in improving efficiency and user experience (example: "AJAX allows us to partially update a page without refreshing the whole page.")
5. Large Request Management: Properly identifies large operation handling without freezing the program (example: "It will help the users making it possible to express waiting for long running actions without freezing the program during these actions.") 

Negative Rubric Items:
1. Incomplete Refreshing Explanation: Lacks detail on specific component refreshing (example: "Because we want to change the page without reloading it.")
2. Blockage Misunderstanding: Misinterprets asynchronous programming's non-blocking nature (example: "Because we want to...send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of my interface.")
3. Sequential Misinterpretation: Inaccurately suggests all implementation happens simultaneously (example: "we don't need to run one process after another process and can run them simultaneously.")
4. AJAX Knowledge Gap: Does not adequately explain AJAX's role (example: "Because it allows other code to run and for the user to continue using the page while other instructions are executing that may take a long time, like waiting for an HTTP response")
5. Poor Large Request Management Insight: Fails to correctly describe handling of extensive operations (example: "In cases where a function or something takes a long time to complete, such as making an HTTP request, we want to use asynchronous programming so that the program doesn't get blocked waiting for a response and can continue to run.")
