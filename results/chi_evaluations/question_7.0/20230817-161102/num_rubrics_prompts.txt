RUBRICS - 3 ITEMS

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of asynchronous programming, including its purpose and function in JavaScript. They should be able to articulate that it allows the program to execute other tasks while waiting for a specific, potentially time-consuming, task to complete.

2. Impact on User Interface/Experience: The student effectively explains how asynchronous programming assists in updating the user interface without blocking it. They should mention how asynchronous programming ensures the UI remains responsive during network requests or data fetching, allows for partial webpage updates without reloading, and improves overall performance and responsiveness.

3. Ability to apply Asynchronous Programming in Practice: They should be able to provide concrete examples or scenarios where using asynchronous programming would be beneficial, such as AJAX use, handling tasks over the network with delays, or handling long synchronous functions without halting the UI. The student should indicate that multiple tasks can run simultaneously to increase efficiency and that asynchronous programming strategies help prevent the execution of the program from blocking in the event of specific processes taking a long time.

1. Partial Page Refresh & Non-blocking Interface: Students often mentioned that asynchronous programming allows updating a part of a webpage without requiring a complete page refresh. This leads to a non-blocking interface where the user can continue interacting with the application while it processes other tasks.

2. Efficient Task Handling & Improved Performance: There was a recurrent theme of asynchronous programming enabling the simultaneous execution of tasks, particularly those that may take a while to complete. This improves the efficiency, performance, and responsiveness of the application.

3. Handling of Delayed Network Requests: Asynchronous programming contributes to maintaining a responsive User Interface (UI) even when dealing with delayed responses from network requests or fetch requests, hence preventing the application from stalling or causing errors due to unpredictable return times.

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The students should demonstrate a clear understanding of what asynchronous programming is and how it works in JavaScript.
2. Efficiency and Performance: Responses should indicate a recognition of the efficiency that asynchronous programming brings in terms of allowing other tasks to run without being blocked by a slower, ongoing operation.
3. Web Page Update: Assign points for recognizing that asynchronous programming allows selective updating of web pages without a full reload.
4. Interaction with External Resources: Students should explain how asynchronous programming allows interaction with external resources, such as databases or web services, without blocking the main thread.
5. User Interface Responsiveness: The response should include an understanding of how asynchronous programming increases user interface responsiveness by allowing long tasks to execute in the background.

THEMES - 5 ITEMS

1. Non-blocking nature of asynchronous programming: Many responses highlighted the ability of asynchronous programming to allow other operations to run without blocking or waiting for a certain task to finish.
2. Efficient and dynamic update of web pages: Another common theme was the ability to change or update a part of the web page without reloading the entire page. This allows for more efficient and user-friendly web experiences.
3. Work in background without interrupting existing operations: Students often mentioned the ability to run tasks in the background, uninterrupted, while the main thread continues to execute other tasks.
4. Responsiveness to user events and actions: Many students pointed out that asynchronous programming allows the program to respond to other user inputs/events while a certain operation is running, enhancing the user experience.
5. Handling of long duration tasks or API calls: Asynchronous programming's suitability for handling long-duration tasks, such as API calls, was a frequent topic. Asynchronous programming allows these types of commands to be processed smoothly, increasing the overall efficiency of the program.

1. Partial Page Updates: Asynchronous programming allows for parts of a web page to be updated without having to refresh the whole page, which provides a smoother, more efficient user experience.

2. Non-Blocking Operations: Asynchronous programming enables tasks to be executed without blocking the rest of the code, letting users continue to interact with the page.

3. Concurrent Requests: It allows for multiple calls or requests to be made simultaneously, increasing the efficiency and speed of web operations.
