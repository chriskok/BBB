THEMES - CLOSEST TO MEAN

1. Partial Page Updates: Asynchronous programming allows us to update specific parts of a web page without having to refresh the entire page.
2. Non-Blocking Code Execution: Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform time-intensive tasks, especially retrieving data from remote servers, without halting or blocking the execution of the rest of the code.
3. User Experience: It allows a more responsive and seamless user experience as users can continue to interact with various elements and functions of a webpage while other tasks are processing.
4. Concurrent Task Execution: Asynchronous programming allows for multiple tasks to be handled simultaneously, ensuring the application doesn't become unresponsive.
5. Server Interaction: It enables the sending, receiving, and requesting of data from servers without impeding or blocking other tasks or user interaction.

RUBRICS - CLUSTER 10

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming Definition: The response should include a clear definition of asynchronous programming in Javascript. For example, asynchronous programming allows us to start long tasks while still running other tasks, improving responsiveness and performance. 

2. Knowledge of Page Reloading: Students should mention that asynchronous programming allows changing or updating a page (or section of a page) without necessitating a full page reload.

3. Understanding of User Interface Blocking: The answer should include an explanation of how asynchronous programming can prevent the blocking of the user interface, allowing users to continue interacting with the page while lengthy operations are ongoing.

4. Proficiency in Application Performance: Asynchronous programming enables less communication between server and user, improving application performance. This concept needs to be addressed in the responses.

5. Comprehension of Improving Responsiveness: The responses should articulate that asynchronous programming in JavaScript can enhance the responsiveness of applications, due to the non-blocking nature of tasks.
