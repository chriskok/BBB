FULL CONTEXT PROMPT

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The student should clearly explain what asynchronous programming is, that it allows different pieces of code to run simultaneously without having to wait for one task to complete before starting another.

2. Use of Practical Examples: The student uses relevant examples to illustrate their understanding of asynchronous programming, such as fetch requests, AJAX, or I/O functions.

3. Explanation of UI Updating: The student adequately explains how asynchronous programming povides the ability to update elements of the user interface without refreshing the whole page.

4. Discussion on Non-blocking Nature: The student should point out that asynchronous programming in Javascript makes it possible for requests to run in the background without stopping or blocking other actions from occurring.

5. Understanding of Real-world Application: Discusses the advantages this brings in terms of user interaction and responsiveness, i.e., the rest of the webpage remains responsive while a part of it is still awaiting certain operations to finish.

6. Mention of Key JavaScript concepts: Student identifies terms and concepts such as 'Promises', 'Ajax', or callbacks that are integral to asynchronous programming in JavaScript. 

7. Interaction with a server: Discusses how asynchronous programming can be used to send, request, and receive data from a server without disrupting user interface interaction.
