RUBRICS - 20 ANSWERS

1. Explanation of Asynchronous Programming: The student should clearly explain what asynchronous programming is and why is it useful in Javascript. 

2. Better User Experience: The student should highlight how asynchronous programming prevents the entire page from being reloaded and only updates the necessary parts, leading to improved web performance and user experience.

3. Non-Blocking Nature and Multitasking: The student should explain that asynchronous programming in Javascript enables the execution of code in the background, it allows multitasking, and it doesn't block the rest of the code and the user interface.

4. Event Handling: They should discuss that asynchronous programming is essential for handling events, allowing users to interact with the website while tasks are being executed in the background.

5. API Communication: In their response, the student should mention how asynchronous programming is effective when calling data from an API - the data can arrive when ready without freezing the entire application.

6. Use of Technical Terms: The student should use relevant technical terms related to asynchronous programming, such as AJAX, Promises, event listeners, etc., demonstrating their understanding of the concepts involved.

7. Use of Real-World Examples: Points should be awarded for providing practical examples or scenarios where asynchronous programming in Javascript would be beneficial.

8. Clarity and Organization: The students' answers should be clear, logically structured, and coherent. The complexities of asynchronous programming should be presented in an understandable manner.

THEMES - 20 ANSWERS

Main themes and recurrent topics that students emphasized are:

1. Improved Efficiency: It allows elements of a page to be updated or changed without having to reload the entire page. This results in a faster, more efficient user experience.
2. Multitasking: It allows multiple tasks to run concurrently - one task can start and run while waiting for another task to complete.
3. Non-blocking: Asynchronous programming enables non-blocking operations. Code execution can continue without waiting for tasks that take a long time to complete.
4. User Experience: Users can continue to interact with other elements of the interface while waiting for certain tasks to complete.
5. Use with APIs: It's beneficial when calling data from an API, allowing the program to retrieve data in the background without freezing the rest of the application.
6. AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server in the background. This means the entire web page does not need to be reloaded for every change, leading to better performance.
7. Event-Driven: It facilitates responding to user actions (events) in real time , thereby improving the interactive nature of web applications.

THEMES - 40 ANSWERS

The main themes or recurrent topics that students emphasized in their responses include:

1. Reduction of Page Load Time: Asynchronous programming allows for parts of a webpage to be updated without requiring the whole page to reload.

2. Efficient execution of code: Asynchronous programming can handle tasks that require longer execution time without blocking the rest of the code. This feature improves the user interface experience as it keeps the application responsive and interactive.

3. Use with AJAX: Many students mentioned the use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) to send, request, and receive server data without disrupting the user interface.

4. Parallel Task Execution: Asynchronous programming facilitates running multiple tasks simultaneously, thus improving overall efficiency and speed.

5. Handling server requests: Students mentioned that when server responses can take time, asynchronous programming allows other tasks to continue while waiting for the server's response. This factor is crucial for optimum utilization of resources and maintaining a good user experience.

6. Usability during I/O operations: This prevents the user interface from being blocked while waiting for input/output operations to complete.
