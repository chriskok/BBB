RUBRICS - 20 ANSWERS

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The answer should correctly describe what asynchronous programming is, stating that it allows tasks that take a long time to run in the background, thereby not blocking the flow of the code.
   
2. Application in JavaScript: The answer should express an understanding of the application of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, especially how it pertains to user experience. Examples would be updating a part of a page without needing to reload it and allowing the user to interact with other site features while waiting for a server response.
   
3. Importance in Single-threaded Languages: The response should highlight the importance of asynchronous programming in single-threaded languages like JavaScript. Specifically, it should mention that JavaScript can only handle one task at a time and asynchronous programming allows for tasks to be handed off and not block the ongoing thread.
   
4. Event Handler Utilization: The student must mention that asynchronous programming allows for multiple event handlers, enabling responses to multiple user interactions even if one function might take a longer to execute.
   
5. AJAX Understanding: Recognition of the role AJAX plays in asynchronous programming—being used to update page content without needing to refresh the entire page, interact with external resources, or execute long tasks like HTTP responses without code blockages.
   
6. Efficiency and Responsiveness: The response should specifically emphasize how asynchronous programming can make applications more efficient and responsive, by allowing simultaneous task execution and not making the users wait for a task to complete before beginning another.

THEMES - 40 ANSWERS

Several main themes and recurrent topics have emerged from the students' descriptions for the use of asynchronous programming in Javascript:

1. Non-blocking code: Asynchronous programming allows the program to perform other tasks while waiting for a potentially long-running operation to complete. The program does not have to wait for a function or command to finish before moving onto the next one. This increases efficiency and performance.

2. User interface interaction: A key point highlighted by the students is that asynchronous programming enables the user to continue interacting with the website while code is being executed in the background. This ensures the user interface stays responsive and results in a better user experience.

3. Partial page updates: Asynchronous programming enables selective or partial updating of web pages without reloading the entire page. This feature is particularly beneficial for large or complex web pages, keeping them more streamlined and efficient.

4. Handling server requests: Asynchronous programming makes it possible to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the application's interface. 

5. Simultaneous tasks: Students articulated that using asynchronous programming allows for multiple tasks to run at once, improving the overall speed and responsiveness of web applications. 

6. Handling delays: Asynchronous programming enables the managing of operations which may take an indefinite amount of time, such as API fetch requests. It avoids freezing the whole program while waiting for these time-consuming tasks to complete.

The main ideas highlighted by the students are:

1. Partial Page Updates: Asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows for updating specific parts of a web page without needing to reload the entire page.

2. Non-Blocking Execution: Asynchronous programming allows for functions or tasks that take a significant amount of time, like API calls, to execute in the background or "asynchronously". This doesn't block other parts of code execution, improving overall program responsiveness and user experience.

3. Concurrent Task Management: Asynchronous programming enables handling of multiple tasks concurrently, even if one task is waiting for server response or user input. This increases efficiency and can improve load times.

4. Improved User Experience: As a combination of the above, asynchronous programming can provide seamless and uninterrupted user interaction, even with tasks taking a longer time to process in the background.

5. AJAX and APIs: Asynchronous programming includes AJAX, a technique used to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface. More generally, asynchronous programming is essential for managing server requests/responses effectively.

6. Event Responsiveness: Asynchronous programming allows a program to be responsive to multiple events while potentially long-running tasks are being processed.
