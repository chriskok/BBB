AUTO SCENARIO 2

- User Needs Identification: Understand the challenges or problems users face.
- Idea Validation: Confirm whether proposed designs or solutions meet user requirements.
- User Feedback: Collect opinions and suggestions on existing or proposed solutions.
- Understanding User Conduct: Discover the user's mental models and typical terminology.
- Prototype Testing: Evaluate the effectiveness and usability of a new product or design.


Positive Rubric Items:
- User Needs Understanding: Demonstrates understanding of learning user requirements (example: "Helps understand user needs")
- Design Validation: Aptly explains how user research helps in validating solutions (example: "Helps improve design")
- Efficacy of Feedback: Understands importance of feedback in product development (example: "Evaluate user needs")
- Comprehension of Mental Models: Appreciates that user research uncovers familiar user terminology and models (example: "- Help uncover user mental model - Help uncover user's familiar terminology")
- Prototyping Evaluation: Recognises role of user research in testing designs (example: "Validate prototype UI via think aloud")

Negative Rubric Items:
- Overemphasis on Ideation: Overestimates the role of ideation without reference to user research utility (example: "We need ideation to generate potential solutions.")
- Too Focused on Empathy: Excessively focuses on empathy instead of practical aspects of user research (example: "One purpose of user research is to have greater empathy for a user's problems.")
- Ignorance of Terminology: Neglects to mention the understanding of user familiar terminologies (example: "- can make your project geared towards a specific group")
- Unstructured Process Description: Displays loose concept of the structured process of user research (example: "Then after the feedback of the low-fidelity prototype, if its good enough and fix it accordingly to the feedback...")
- Ignoring Users' Feedback: Not mentioning the importance of user feedback for product improvement (example: "1.) Identify the design problem 2.) Identify solutions that work")

AUTO NO THEME SCENARIO

Positive Rubric Items:

- User Need Identification: Student correctly mentioned identifying user needs (e.g., "Identify the problems or challenges users are facing.")
- Solution Validation: Response includes validating potential solutions through user research (e.g., "validate whether proposed design fits user needs")
- User Feedback Utilization: Recognizes importance of receiving user feedback (e.g., "Get user feedback on existing ideas or products")
- Mental Model Uncovering: Understands research helps uncover user's mental models (e.g., "Help uncover user mental model")
- User Understanding: Notes purpose of user research for empathy and understanding limitations (e.g., "have greater empathy for a user's problems")

Negative Rubric Items:

- Vague Answer: Student gives a generic answer without specific steps (e.g., "Helps understand user needs")
- Missing Validation: Fail to mention idea or solution validation (e.g., "understand user needs so that people creating products")
- Excludes Feedback: Doesn't specify user feedback for improvement (e.g., "Observation - Watching and learning from a distance")
- Lack of Empathy: Doesn't mention to better understand or empathize users (e.g., "Helps improve design")
- Misunderstands Purpose: Confuses product stages such as prototypes with user research (e.g., "Then we create low-fidelity prototypes").
