The student should mention how user research validates potential solutions through processes like storyboarding, feedback on prototypes, and think-aloud protocols.

3. Ensuring Product Effectiveness and Usability: The student should discuss the application of user research later in the product life cycle to evaluate and measure how well the product performs in the real-world, detecting usability issues, and obtaining user feedback for product improvement.

4. User Research for Testing and Improvement: The student should discuss utilizing user research for the testing of prototypes and products, identifying problems and bugs, and guiding further product development based on this feedback.

5. User Research for Ideation: This aspect involves using user research to better brainstorm and form ideas. By identifying user needs and obtaining user feedback, the ideation process becomes more directed towards creating solutions that fulfil user needs and preferences. This could be mentioned in the context of gathering insight for generating potential solutions.
