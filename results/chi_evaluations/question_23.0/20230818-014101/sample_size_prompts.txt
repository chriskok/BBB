RUBRICS - 20 ANSWERS

Rubric Items:

1. Identification of User Needs: Students should clearly identify that one purpose of user research is to determine the needs and requirements of the target users. They can also discuss the techniques used for this, such as interviews or use of personas. 

2. Validation and Idea Generation: Students should mention that user research helps in validating the feasibility and desirability of ideas and prototypes. This could follow brainstorming during the ideation phase.

3. Feedback and Iteration: Responses should include the use of user research for gathering feedback about the product's usability, functionality, and overall user experience. This feedback is used to make improvements during subsequent iterations of the product's design.

4. Understanding User Context: The students should note that user research helps understand contextual information about the user, including their behaviors, attitudes, motivations, and environment.

5. User Involvement: Students should mention the continuous involvement of users at all stages of the design process and the need to consider and value the user's perspective in decision-making related to product design and development.

6. Bug Identification: Students should identify that user research is vital for troubleshooting and identifying any potential problems or issues with the product before it's released.

7. Post-release Evaluation: Finally, it should be mentioned that user research can be used to gather feedback once a product has been released, to inform future updates and potential areas for improvement.

THEMES - 20 ANSWERS

The main themes that the students emphasized in their answers are:

1. Identifying and Understanding User Needs: Students repeatedly noted that user research is crucial for determining the needs, wants, motivations, and challenges of the target users. They highlighted different tools for this phase, such as interviews, affinity diagrams, and contextual inquiries.

2. Idea Generation: They also emphasized that user research plays a key role in generating ideas that address the identified user needs. Techniques such as brainstorming and the use of storyboards were highlighted.

3. Testing and Validation: Many responses focused on using user research to test and validate potential solutions, prototypes, or design decisions. Students mentioned techniques like user testing, think-aloud sessions, speed dating, and receiving feedback post-launch for ongoing improvement.

4. Iteration and Improvement: Few students underlined the importance of using user research in drawing feedback from users after a product is released in the market, as a way to continually improve the product in line with user preferences and needs. 

5. Understanding the User: A recurring theme is use of research to understand who the users are, their specific characteristics, behaviors, and how they will interact with the product.
   
6. Evaluation of Usability: There were mentions of user research being used to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a product, looking for bugs, and identifying other improvement areas. 

7. Involvement of users at all stages: Lastly, some students stressed on the significance of involving users at all stages of the design process echoing the heart of user-centered design.
