AUTO SCENARIO 2

- Identifying User Needs: Gathering insights on the user's wants, problems, and situations.
- Ideation and Brainstorming: Generating solutions based on the identified user needs.
- Prototyping and User Feedback: Gaining valuable insights through user interaction with designed prototypes.
- Testing and Validating: Comprehending the effectiveness and impact of the solution in addressing user needs.
- Iteration and Refinement: Using feedback from usability tests to improve design and functionality.
- User Context Understanding: Understanding specific language, behavior and contexts around users.

Positive Rubric Items:
- Understanding User Needs: Demonstrated comprehension of the need to identify user requirements. (Example: "In the need finding phase, we use user research to establish what problems most users encounter...")
- Effective Ideation: Showed the ability to incorporate user needs into potential solutions. (Example: "Ideation, where potential solutions can be identified and evaluated by using user research...")
- Use of Prototypes: Recognized the importance of prototyping in user research. (Example: "Prototyping, where design and development take place; user research can guide the design...")
- Acknowledging User Feedback: Appreciated the role of user feedback in refining designs. (Example: "We can gather feedback on our initial design to determine ways to make it more effective...")
- Recognizing Validation/Testing: Understood the need for testing and validating prototypes for usability. (Example: "The third purpose is to testing, where a sample of individuals from the target population tests the design suitability...")

Negative Rubric Items:
- Misunderstanding User Needs: Failed to grasp the importance of identifying user needs in the early stages. (Example: "Observation - Watching and learning from a distance, considering context when people are not watching the participant")
- Ambiguity in Ideation: Did not explain how user needs influence the ideation process. (Example: "We can do user research for inspiration, ideation, or implementation.")
- Neglecting Prototyping: Overlooked the significance of user interaction with prototypes in user research. (Example: "We then go into ideation which is brainstorming ideas based off of what the users' needs were...")
- Ignoring User Feedback: Did not recognize the value of user feedback in refining the product. (Example: "The goal of the product is to fulfill what their user needs...")
- Disregarding Validation/Testing: Did not acknowledge the critical role of testing and validation in user research. (Example: "Combine similar ideas to find user needs")
