FULL CONTEXT PROMPT

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The student should show a clear understanding of what is meant by asynchronous programming in Javascript. This can be determined by making reference to concepts like callback functions, Promises, and async/await syntax.
 
2. Explanation of Non-Blocking Code: The student should explain how asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to be non-blocking, meaning it can carry on with other tasks while waiting for another task to complete. They should demonstrate an understanding of how Javascript, as a single-threaded language, uses asynchronous programming to overcome issues of blocking or waiting for tasks to finish.

3. Application to Real Scenarios: The student should give practical examples or scenarios where asynchronous programming is beneficial. For instance, making an API request, reading files, or any operation that might take time to respond.

4. Performance Enhancement: The student should explain how asynchronous code can improve performance or the user experience by allowing tasks to run concurrently or in the background.

5. Explanation of Event Loop: It would be an added advantage if the student can explain the concept of the Event Loop in JavaScript, which handles asynchronous callbacks. 

6. Understanding of Callback Hell: The student can also discuss problems associated with asynchronous code, like callback hell, and how modern approaches like Promises and async/await help resolve these issues.

7. Comparison with Synchronous Code: A thorough answer might involve comparison with synchronous programming, its limitations, and how asynchronous programming provides a solution to those limitations.
