RUBRICS - 20 ANSWERS

1. Understanding of Asynchronous Programming: The answer should demonstrate a clear understanding of asynchronous programming and how it works with Javascript. This understanding should include a working knowledge of callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax.

2. Providing a Reason for Asynchronous Programming: A proper response should correctly identify the main reasons for using asynchronous programming in Javascript, such as preventing blocking or improving application performance by allowing other code to run while waiting for operations like network requests to complete.

3. Mention of Non-Blocking Benefit: Students should point out that one of the main benefits of asynchronous programming is that it allows for non-blocking operations. They should also be able to explain what non-blocking operations are and how they improve overall performance.

4. Knowledge of Real-World Applications: The answer should also include examples or explanations of real-world scenarios where asynchronous programming would be beneficial.

5. Clarity and Coherence: Lastly, responses should be clearly articulated, accurately written, and logically structured - illustrating a systematic understanding of how asynchronous programming works in Javascript.

The main themes or recurrent topics emphasized include:
1. Identifying User Needs: Students stress the importance of asynchronous programming in recognizing the needs of users. This allows developers to understand what problems users face and design accordingly.
2. Generating Solutions: Once the problems are identified, students mention that asynchronous programming helps generate probable solutions which directly address these issues and provide an efficient way to tackle them.
3. Testing and Validation: Students also emphasize the role of asynchronous programming in testing products to ensure usability and functionality. It helps in receiving feedback and making necessary iterations.
4. Improve User Experience: Many students highlight the importance of asynchronous programming in improving overall user experiences. By observing user interactions, familiar terminologies, and mental models, developers can create more intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly products.
5. Prototyping: Asynchronous programming aids in creating prototypes that can be tested and evaluated based on user interactions.
6. Comparison with Market Products: Some students mentioned that user research could identify how the potential product compares to existing market products and helps inform implementation strategies.
