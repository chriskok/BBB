AUTO SCENARIO 2

- Asynchronous Data Processing: Asynchrony allows non-blocking code execution, improving speed and efficiency.
- Improved User Experience: Async programming ensures smooth UI, without freezing during data-intensive operations.
- Handling Multiple Operations: Allows simultaneous handling of multiple tasks without waiting for a single task completion.
- Server Communication: It facilitates effective communication with servers, enhancing responsiveness.
- Improved Performance: Asynchrony leads to performance benefits in loading or processing large volumes of data.
- Task Simplicity: JavaScript's asynchronous nature enables decomposition of complex tasks into simpler ones.

Positive Rubric Items:
- Asynchronous Data Processing Understanding: Recognizes async programming allows non-blocking operations (example: "Asynchrony allows non-blocking code execution, improving speed and efficiency.")
- User Experience Considerations: Understands async coding prevents UI freezing during data retrieval or processing (example: "Async programming ensures smooth UI, without freezing during data-intensive operations.")
- Handling Multiple Operations: Correctly identifies async programming allows for parallel task handling (example: "Allows simultaneous handling of multiple tasks without waiting for a single task completion.")
- Server Communication: Understands async programming enhances server communication and responsiveness (example: "It facilitates effective communication with servers, enhancing responsiveness.")
- Performance Benefit Recognition: Identifies async programming can boost performance when dealing with large data sets (example: "Asynchrony leads to performance benefits in loading or processing large volumes of data.")

Negative Rubric Items:
- Misunderstanding Non-Blocking: Incorrectly believes async programming blocks other operations (example: "Async programming means operations must wait their turn.")
- Misinterpreting User Experience: Fails to connect async programming with smoother user experience (example: "User interface responsiveness is unrelated to async programming.")
- Incorrect View on Task Handling: Misinterprets async programming as sequential task processing (example: "Async programming processes tasks one after another.")
- Not Relating to Server Communication: Doesn't link async programming to improved server communication (example: "Async programming has no impact on server communication.")
- Misconstruing Performance: Fails to see how asynchronous programming enhances performance (example: "Async programming slows down the program when processing large amount of data.")
