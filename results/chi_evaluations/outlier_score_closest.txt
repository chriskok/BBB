When writing web apps, we often read and write to a server which takes time. To make sure each function has completely finished running, we need to wait for each function. Otherwise, if we execute in real time (synchronous) we may not get desired output.  As an example, consider an app that writes a to-do list to a server. We want to add an item to the list and then print the list. Adding an item may take more time than printing. So, if asynchronous programming is not used the list that is printed will be the list before the new item was added which is not the desired output.	0.7401180863380432

It allows us to update parts of a webpage at a time in order to handle requests to/from servers and avoid having to re-render the entire page.	0.6132840514183044	
Async programming allows long running operations to happen while allowing the rest of the app to remain unblocked	0.6131754517555237	
We don't want to shoehorn the users into a specific route on the application, we want them to be able to click any button at any time, and this can only be achieved through event listeners and the like which are examples of asynchronous programming.	0.6119893193244934	
It enables a program to execute potentially long-running tasks and be responsive to other tasks while it is running. 	0.6118528842926025	
It allows us to make changes to pages without reloading. Additionally, we can send, request, and receive data from our server without interrupting or blocking the rest of our interface. 	0.6115306615829468	
It helps change a page without having to reload it and you can send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface.	0.6077942252159119	
Its useful as multiple parts of the application can be executed without having to wait for one another, which is especially important in making requests for servers or waiting for complex tasks to load. It also allows you to change a page without reloading it.	0.6073114275932312	
Tasks over the network always have delays. We want the UI to remain responsive when it is completing a network request, which requires asynchronously fetching data so that it doesn't block the execution of the main thread.	0.6069770455360413	
We are able to take advantage of the functionality as it allows us to express waiting for certain actions without stalling the program. As many programs interact with users, this becomes essential. It allows the parts of the program that don't require input to continue and improves efficiency. 	0.6062972545623779	
This allows us to not interrupt the entire interface when the user prompts the website to make calls to a server. It can run in the background while the user can still interact with the interface.	0.6040945053100586	
So that we can change a page without reloading and send, request and receive data from a server while other parts of the interface function well.	0.6015568375587463	
If you have several tasks that you want the application to operate. This allows you to complete multiple tasks at once since it isn't necessary for the application to wait to complete them individually. This can be very beneficial in web dev/user experience when delays can occur.	0.6015017628669739	
It allows us to perform actions that may take some time while still loading the rest of the UI and letting users interact with it.	0.6014249920845032	
Because we are able to make things happen at the same time; this way, a longer task won't stop other code from being executed, for example. Conversely, it can also be used as a good way to make things wait to execute until other promises are fulfilled.	0.5996044874191284	
This allows us to perform multiple tasks at once without blocking the execution from a different task. 	0.5975930094718933	
It allows for other tasks to be done while a larger task is processing in the background rather than having a task stop the program.	0.5973771810531616	
Because it allows us to execute instructions that might take a long time from a server without blocking the rest of the interface and allows users to interact with the UI.	0.596512496471405	
Because sometimes you would want to execute other functions while waiting for one function to finish.	0.593328058719635	
It's important to be able to perform a task that has to wait without pausing the rest of the program.	0.5896375775337219	
It allows changing a page without reloading it and makes it possible to send, request, and receive data without blocking the rest of the interface.	0.5895899534225464	
There are several reasons: 1, We want to update only part of the page without reloading the entire page. 2, We can make request and receive the data we want without blocking the rest of other operations. 	0.5877654552459717	
It enables you to change a page without reloading it (partial page refresh) and lets you send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface. 	0.587425172328949	
It allows for us to process long running tasks and still be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than everything being halted while that one task is going	0.5869437456130981	
We want to do this so the user can continue using the web page while a background process is being completed. For example, in A5 when we were fetching from the Itunes API,  we wanted the webpage to still be active and have stuff going on, but the fetching was being done in the background. 	0.5829450488090515	
Because it is a means of loading data from the server and selectively updating parts of a web page without loading the whole page over and over again	0.582880973815918	
There may be times where we are required to wait for a response from a server, for example. During this time, we still want the user to be able to use other features on a site, without being locked out until a response is received.	0.5826462507247925	
To be able to execute other tasks while a task is still running in the background. It can be very useful for running concurrent tasks and therefore not having to wait for one task to finish before moving on to other tasks. 	0.5811475515365601	
We can execute functions in the background of a page and update sections of the page without reloading all of the contents.	0.5800064206123352	
We want to use it to enable our program to start a potentially long-running task and still be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until the task is finished.	0.5790477991104126	
So we can perform multiple tasks at once and to listen to multiple events at once. For example clicking a button should not interfere or wait for a previous button that I clicked and is still processing.	0.5699468851089478	
It enables changing a page without reloading it and it allows us to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface.	0.5662184357643127	
It can change a page without reloading it. and It can send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface.	0.5541346073150635	
Because we want to change the page without reloading it and send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of my interface. 	0.5541316866874695	
This is because we cannot determine when the users would interact with things and what they would try to interact with. With these variables, it is best to code in asynchronous programming as this eliminates the need to design major intertwined systems with hardcoded data sets and can cover much more scenarios regarding user inputs.	0.554069459438324	
It changes the page without reloading it and can send, request and receive data without blocking the rest of the interface	0.551756739616394

1. It enables me to change a page without reloading it. 2. It enables me to send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of my interface.	0.5435909628868103	
This is to allow other components when showing the webpage does not get blocked by operations that require long time.	0.5424737334251404	
This allows for multiple tasks to run at the same time.	0.5406820774078369	
you can run a long task in the background and the program will be able to respond to other user events. Won't be bottlenecked and waiting until the task is finished.	0.5383984446525574	
We want to be able to make changes to a page without reloading it every time. We also want to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the interface. 	0.5339744091033936	
We can change a page without reloading it and send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface.	0.5266961455345154	
sometime the response takes time and we would like the user to still interact with part of the page.	0.5228397250175476	
This way you don't have to wait for things to happen to update other separate parts of a webpage/app.	0.5138096213340759	
– Change a page without reloading it – Send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface	0.4922524094581604

Change a page without reloading it Send, request and receive data from a server without  blocking the rest of your interface 	0.44905903935432434	
Because it allow us to modify the website without having to send the data every time a change is made	0.44150906801223755	
This will allow users to continue to use your website/app, while you work on parts of the website while not interfering with traffic to your website.	0.43683257699012756	
This is because it allows for some of the parts of a page to update while others remain the same.	0.43608802556991577	
Make sure the program can respond to other tasks while a long task is running, so that it does not have to wait until that task is finished to begin other tasks.	0.4181101620197296	
We want to execute some instructions without blocking other lines of code. 	0.41267484426498413	
We have to wait for certain data to load (i.e. response of api call), so it pauses execution while this data is missing.	0.3449758291244507
