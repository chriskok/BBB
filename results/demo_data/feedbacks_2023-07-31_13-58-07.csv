3180,"Asynchronous programming allows the user to decide what elements of the code need to be run, instead of requiring a specific order.",37,"Good start, but try to elaborate more on how asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and improves user experience."
3183,"We want to use asynchronous programming in Javascript as we want to update parts of the webpage without having to reload the whole page Through AJAX, we can send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface. This is better than synchronous Javascript wherein we can only update the page by reloading it and wherein all the event handling takes place in a single loop.",39,"Great job! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and updates without reloading the page. However, remember that reloading the page is not a desirable aspect."
3189,"Asynchronous programming allows for updating a page without refreshing the whole page. Also, long-running functions can be executed without blocking the rest of the code and interaction.",40,Excellent! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and improves user interaction.
3195,We want to use asynchronous programming in JavaScript when we have a promise that we are waiting to be resolved and we want to run other operations in meanwhile. It allows us to efficient and responsive web applications and prevent lag due to a request.,38,Excellent! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and improves efficiency.
3201,It allows us to run long execution time programs without making the user wait for the program to finish before using the webpage. ,36,Great work! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for background tasks and user interaction.
3207,"– Change a page without reloading it
– Send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface",33,Excellent! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and updates without reloading the page.
3219,"We want to use asynchronous programming in Javascript because our web applications often have to wait for data to be loaded into the program. Often, it is the case that programming in Javascript attempts to fetch some data. In this process, we don't know how long it will take for the data to be fetched. We don't want to block the user from interacting with the application while the data is being fetched, so we take advantage of asynchronous programming to allow the user to continue to interact with the application until the data is loaded.",44,"Good job! You've correctly explained that asynchronous programming prevents blocking of user interaction during data fetch. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this allows for dynamic page updates without reloading."
3234,Because sometimes you would want to execute other functions while waiting for one function to finish.,35,Good job! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution. Try to elaborate more on how this improves user experience.
3249,you can run a long task in the background and the program will be able to respond to other user events. Won't be bottlenecked and waiting until the task is finished.,34,Well done! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for background tasks and user interaction.
3294,"Using asynchronous programming in JavaScript allows the user to seamlessly navigate the program without running into any delays or errors. This is because asynchronous programming allows certain processes to run in the background while users continue to do other tasks. Additionally, asynchronous programming allows coders to segment their code into smaller sections for a more organized and efficient workspace.",42,Great job! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for seamless user interaction and background task execution. You could further improve your answer by explaining how this prevents the need for page reloads.
3303,Async programming in Javascript allows us to partially update a page without refreshing the whole page. It also lets us execute instructions that may take a longer time without blocking the rest of the code.,46,Excellent! You've correctly explained that asynchronous programming allows for partial page updates and non-blocking execution of instructions. This indeed enhances user interaction and prevents the need for page reloads.
3363,"Asynchronous programming is useful because it allows a flow of logic to be consistent during fetch requests/promises, which would otherwise cause errors if the code didn't halt during these requests. In other words, fetch requests have variable return time, so its important to wait for the response before moving forward.",47,"Good job! You've correctly explained that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution during fetch requests. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this enhances user interaction and allows for dynamic page updates without reloading."
3432,This allows for multiple tasks to run at the same time.,41,"Your answer is partially correct. You've mentioned that asynchronous programming allows for multiple tasks to run simultaneously, which is true. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this non-blocking execution enhances user interaction and prevents the need for page reloads."
3450,"This will allow users to continue to use your website/app, while you work on parts of the website while not interfering with traffic to your website.",32,Great job! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows users to continue interacting with the website/app while updates are made.
3694,Asynchronous programming allows us to change a page without needed to reload the entire page.,49,"Your answer is partially correct. You've mentioned that asynchronous programming allows for changes to a page without reloading, which is true. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this enhances user interaction and allows for non-blocking execution of tasks."
3703,"Because we may want to change a page without reloading it or send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface.
For synchronous JavaScript, all event handling runs in just one single loop",50,"Good job! You've correctly explained that asynchronous programming allows for changes to a page without reloading and non-blocking data transactions. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this enhances user interaction."
3818,"Asynchronous programming allows us to dynamically update part of a page without refreshing the entire page. It also lets us execute instructions that take longer at the same time as other code, so users can still use the website normally.",43,Excellent! You've correctly explained that asynchronous programming allows for dynamic page updates and concurrent execution of instructions. This indeed enhances user interaction and prevents the need for page reloads.
4025,Asynchronous programming allows the program to start and run long tasks without halting the code. This means it can perform other tasks and respond to events without having to wait for the long task to complete,45,"Your answer is partially correct. You've mentioned that asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution of tasks, which is true. However, you could improve your answer by explaining how this enhances user interaction and prevents the need for page reloads."
4088,"We have to wait for certain data to load (i.e. response of api call), so it pauses execution while this data is missing.",31,"Good start, but try to elaborate more on how asynchronous programming allows for non-blocking execution and improves user experience."
4346,"We want to be able to make changes to a page without reloading it every time. We also want to send, request, and receive data from a server without blocking the interface. ",48,Great job! You've correctly identified that asynchronous programming allows for changes to a page without reloading and non-blocking data transactions. This indeed enhances user interaction and prevents the need for page reloads.
