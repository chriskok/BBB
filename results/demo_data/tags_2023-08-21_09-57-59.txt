1. Evaluates the needs and constraints of users. What do users care about? What do they dislike or want to improve about current solutions? What can and can't they afford in a design?
2. Feedback and gauging which designs work best for users. What do they like about the ideas presented, what would they want to see, whether an idea addresses their needs or not.
3. Feedback on prototypes/the later stages of design lets designers understand how their design functions when in the hands of a user. It lets designers discover accessibility + clarity issues and further evaluate how useful features are to users.

design products that are geared toward users’ pain points and actual needs. Additionally, using speed dating in the ideation phase allows designers to validate user needs and to probe into users’ preferences in the design space. Lastly, after creating a prototype, participating in a think aloud session helps uncover the users’ thought processes while they’re interacting with the software and find usability issues.
