This is especially important in Javascript because it is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one task can be executed at a time. Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously, improving the performance and responsiveness of various web applications. Additionally, it enables JavaScript applications to interact with external resources, such as databases or web services, without blocking the main thread, which would otherwise make the user interface to freeze.

35: R7 - Asynchronous programming is a way for a program to run a potentially long-running task and still be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. This is especially important in Javascript because it is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one task can be executed at a time. Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously, improving the performance and responsiveness of various web applications. Additionally, it enables JavaScript applications to interact with external resources, such as databases or web services, without blocking the main thread, which would otherwise make the user interface to freeze.

35: R1 - When writing web apps, we often read and write to a server which takes time. To make sure each function has completely finished running, we need to wait for each function. Otherwise, if we execute in real time (synchronous) we may not get desired output.

As an example, consider an app that writes a to-do list to a server. We want to add an item to the list and then print the list. Adding an item may take more time than printing. So, if asynchronous programming is not used the list that is printed will be the list before the new item was added which is not the desired output.
