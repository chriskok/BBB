36: R1 - In the starting stage of the IDEO framework, we do user research to understand the user needs and conduct research to get ideas about what solutions are needed. Thus,  after brainstorming a list of solutions to user needs, by doing user research through storyboards and speed dating, we get an idea as to which of the designers solutions are applicable to user needs and what changes we could incorporate into a low fidelity prototype.

Heuristic evaluation and user testing of our low fidelity prototypes with a simple visual interface lets users learn about the simple functionalities of our app, and thus, through the low functionality prototypes and iteration, we get more feedback from the users as to what works for our app and what needs to be implemented for the high fidelity prototypes.  This si the prototyping stage.

For our high fidelity prototypes, we can conduct think alouds to get an understand of what specific features of our app is considered positive by users. Thus, through more iteration and think aloud with a large subset of people, we address the UI issues and usabliity issues to make a functional app for our users. This is the testing stage

36: R1 - In IDEO, need-finding helps designers uncover users’ processes and challenges and
design products that are geared toward users’ pain points and actual needs. Additionally, using speed dating in the ideation phase allows designers to validate user needs and to probe into users’ preferences in the design space. Lastly, after creating a prototype, participating in a think aloud session helps uncover the users’ thought processes while they’re interacting with the software and find usability issues.
