35: Asynchronous programming allows the user to decide what elements of the code need to be run, instead of requiring a specific order.
You've touched on the flexibility of asynchronous programming, but remember that it's not about the user deciding the order of code execution. It's more about allowing tasks to run concurrently without blocking the user interface.,[{"answer_highlight": "user to decide what elements", "feedback_highlight": "user deciding the order of code execution"}]

35: We want to use asynchronous programming in Javascript as we want to update parts of the webpage without having to reload the whole page Through AJAX, we can send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of the interface. This is better than synchronous Javascript wherein we can only update the page by reloading it and wherein all the event handling takes place in a single loop.
Great job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows data to be sent, requested, and received from a server without blocking the interface and the page to be updated without reloading it. Try to also discuss how this improves the user experience.,[{"answer_highlight": "update parts of the webpage", "feedback_highlight": "page to be updated without reloading"}, {"answer_highlight": "send, request and receive data", "feedback_highlight": "data to be sent, requested, and received"}]

35: Asynchronous programming allows for updating a page without refreshing the whole page. Also, long-running functions can be executed without blocking the rest of the code and interaction.
Good job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows long-running functions to be executed without blocking the rest of the code and the page to be updated without reloading it. Try to also discuss how this improves the user experience.,[{"answer_highlight": "updating a page without refreshing", "feedback_highlight": "page to be updated without reloading"}, {"answer_highlight": "long-running functions can be executed", "feedback_highlight": "long-running functions to be executed"}]

35: We want to use asynchronous programming in JavaScript when we have a promise that we are waiting to be resolved and we want to run other operations in meanwhile. It allows us to efficient and responsive web applications and prevent lag due to a request.
Good job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows other operations to run while waiting for a promise to be resolved. Try to also discuss how this improves the user experience.,[{"answer_highlight": "run other operations in meanwhile", "feedback_highlight": "other operations to run while waiting"}]

35: It allows us to run long execution time programs without making the user wait for the program to finish before using the webpage. 
Great job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows long execution time programs to run without making the user wait, improving the user experience. Also, consider discussing how this non-blocking execution is achieved.,[{"answer_highlight": "run long execution time programs", "feedback_highlight": "long execution time programs to run"}]

35: – Change a page without reloading it
– Send, request and receive data from a server without blocking the rest of your interface
Great job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows data to be sent, requested, and received from a server without blocking the interface and the page to be updated without reloading it. Try to also discuss how this improves the user experience.,[{"answer_highlight": "Change a page without reloading", "feedback_highlight": "page to be updated without reloading"}, {"answer_highlight": "Send, request and receive data", "feedback_highlight": "data to be sent, requested, and received"}]

35: Because sometimes you would want to execute other functions while waiting for one function to finish.
Good job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows other functions to execute while waiting for one function to finish. Try to also discuss how this improves the user experience.,[{"answer_highlight": "execute other functions while waiting", "feedback_highlight": "other functions to execute while waiting"}]

35: you can run a long task in the background and the program will be able to respond to other user events. Won't be bottlenecked and waiting until the task is finished.
Good job on mentioning that asynchronous programming allows long tasks to run in the background without blocking user events. Also, consider discussing how this non-blocking execution is achieved.,[{"answer_highlight": "run a long task in the background", "feedback_highlight": "long tasks to run in the background"}]

35: This will allow users to continue to use your website/app, while you work on parts of the website while not interfering with traffic to your website.
Well done on highlighting that asynchronous programming allows users to continue interacting with the website/app while updates are being made. Also, consider mentioning how this non-blocking execution is achieved.,[{"answer_highlight": "users to continue to use", "feedback_highlight": "users to continue interacting"}]

35: We have to wait for certain data to load (i.e. response of api call), so it pauses execution while this data is missing.
Good job on recognizing that asynchronous programming allows the program to wait for data to load without blocking execution. Try to also mention how this improves user experience and allows for user interaction during these operations.,[{"answer_highlight": "wait for certain data to load", "feedback_highlight": "wait for data to load"}]
